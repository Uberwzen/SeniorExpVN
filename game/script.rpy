    "As he was dreaming, he felt... content. Not just content, but happy."
    "In his dream, brief scenes fly by as he watched as a 10-second protagonist."
    "He wasn’t allowed to stay, but to just watch for a few moments."
    "He saw his mom cut some cake for him. There were candles placed in a uniform pattern on top."
    "Someone’s birthday? His birthday?"

    Teacher "Now, as we know, before the War, poverty was rampant across our nation."
    Teacher "But through our government’s expansion of global influence and the creation of protectorates, global trade has increased in efficiency by more than ten-fold."
    Teacher "Poverty has been cut to historic-low levels due to our increased wealth and power. Our Department of Life and Charity has overseen all of this great work over the past fifty years."
    Violet "Why do we even need to learn about this? Seriously, if I have to hear the word “poverty” one more time, I’m gonna kill somebody."

    Teacher "Well, not exactly."
    Teacher "They more so fought to protect our nation’s interests, foreign and domestic. Poverty has been nearly eliminated within our borders after our rightful regime took power."
    Teacher "The average citizen is much better off now as compared to fifty years ago."
    Student1 "I mean… I know that’s what we read about, but I think that’s just because of the Draft."
    Student1 "Everybody knows that the Draft is based off income. You haven’t “eliminated poverty,” rather you basically just conscripted all the poor people and sent them to die."
    "(Students whisper amongst themselves)"
    Teacher "Now, where did you learn that from?"
    Teacher "We’ve always taught you that that the Department of Life and Charity cares for its citizens!"

    "His town changed too often. His younger self would have a hard time trying to navigate 18-year-old Violet’s roads."
    "Little Violet would eventually realize that whatever store he was looking for had been shut down and replaced by something a little more “useful”."

    "That insurance company’s building smelled a little too nostalgic for Violet’s liking."

    "Unsurprisingly, Vincent was over by the comics. Violet quickly joined him, trying not to let his eyes linger at the romance section."
    "Vincent would bully him to death."
    Vincent "How’ve you been?"
    Violet "Um...alright."
    Vincent "I saw you got to walk home with Sophia. Good job, man. Violet: Oh, shut up. You know she doesn’t like me back."
    Vincent "Ah, but you have great potential to charm her straight into your arms, my friend."
    Vincent "Listen to me. I know exactly what women like."
    Violet "Uh huh. What’s your body count?"
    Vincent "My what?"
    Violet "..."
    Vincent "I haven’t killed anyone?"
    Violet "..."
    Violet "You have negative ethos right now."
    Vincent "Whatever, man. All I’m saying is that I am a man of action, and you are of inaction. I must guide you, young one."

    Vincent "Violet, Violet, Violet. Women like a calm, collected man. Treat me like you would Sophia for a moment."
    Violet "HUH??"
    Vincent "Actually, forget it. I could never forgive myself if you fell for me."
    Violet "..."
    Violet "Okay."
    "Vincent picked up a comic with a boy on the cover. He wore a big smile and held a comically large sword."
    Vincent "I remember this one. I think I read it at the beginning of the school year."
    Vincent "Hm, funnily enough, the different comics I’ve read are pretty much the most major events of this year. Everything else has felt so dull."
    Violet "Yeah, I guess when you put it into perspective, not much has really happened."
    Vincent "I mean, I guess that’s not a bad thing. Either way, comics make me happy. It’s whatever."
    Violet "Hm, that was almost a smart thing you just said."
    Vincent "Almost? I recite wisdom on the daily."
    Violet "And you ruined it. Back to normal Vincent."
    Vincent "Out of curiosity, because obviously I already know, why did I say something smart?"
    Violet "I don’t know, man. I’ve been thinking about this a lot these days. Looking back at my entire life, I feel like I haven’t really done anything."
    Violet "I worked really hard in school, but I definitely didn’t really get any enjoyment from that. Violet: It was just something that I had to do."
    Violet "Besides studying, there haven’t really been any major events of this year, or really, of my entire life."
    Violet "Everything has just been an investment for a future that I don’t feel too confident about."
    Vincent "I feel that..."
    Violet "That said, I guess this past year was fun. I spent time with friends, my mom taught me how to bake apple pie this one time, and even getting addicted to dating sims was fun in a way."
    Vincent "I kinda get it. But isn’t that obvious? Fun things are fun?"
    Violet "I don’t know, it feels bigger than that. Every headline is a reminder of how fucked the world is, and it’s hard to just be a person sometimes."
    Violet "I guess once in a while, it’s nice to just focus on the smaller things and embrace the things that make me who I am."
    Vincent "Oh yeah, I bet you have to focus on smaller things ahaha..."
    Violet "I actually hate you."
    Vincent "You’re a wise man, Violet. Ladies love wisdom."
    Violet "If that’s true, then I feel kinda bad for you."
    Vincent "Violet, you remind me so much of the protagonist in Under a Sunset"
    Violet "Wait, you read that?"
    Vincent "Wait, you read that? Mr. Too Superior to Read Comics read a romance comic?"
    Violet "Well, I uh—"
    Vincent "What did you think of the ending?"
    Violet "Okay, I actually cried. I’m not usually someone who cries at stories, but that one really got me—wait, why did you read a romance comic?"
    Vincent "I like the author and wanted to see what he could do with romance. He usually stays in the action genre, but switched it up for some reason."
    Violet "Well, I’m glad he did, because he’s a genius. The way he made the moon a symbol of a steady and persistent love was so good."
    Violet "It sounds lame when I say it, but I was so into it. I tear up every time I see the moon in real life now."
    Vincent "Dude, I think the moonshine shit was just an art flex. Light and shadows, you know?"
    Violet "..."
    Vincent "Either way, it was really cool. I liked the stuff he did when he went into the protagonists’ backstories for a few chapters."
    Vincent "It made the stuff happening in the present feel a lot more meaningful."
    Vincent "I reread it again and noticed so much more that I didn’t pick up the first time around."
    Violet "I KNOW–ahem. Yeah, the way he wrote the characters was so well thought out. He avoided so many cliches that I got bored of, so it was pretty refreshing."
    Vincent "I like seeing you like this, man."
    Violet "Huh?"
    Vincent "I don’t know, the way you talk about these types of things makes me kinda happy."
    Vincent "It gives me hope when a moody guy like you can get so passionate about romance stories. You’re a cool guy to hang out with."
    Violet "You’re an... interesting guy. You go from insightful to stupid way too quickly."
    Vincent "Hey, I said something nice so now it’s your turn."
    Violet "You’re... insightful from time to time."
    Vincent "See, you bully me like this yet choose to hang out with me. Speaking of which, I wanted to ask you something."
    Vincent "Break is coming up, so do you wanna go camping? Honestly you don’t really seem like the type, but it could be fun."
    Violet "Yeah, sure!"
    Vincent "That sounded oddly enthusiastic. Am I talking to the real Violet?"

    Violet "I don’t know, it feels bigger than that. Every headline is a reminder of how fucked the world is, and it’s hard to just be a person sometimes."

    Violet "Okay, I actually cried. I’m not usually someone who cries at stories, but that one really got me—wait, why did you read a romance comic?"
    Vincent "I like the author and wanted to see what he could do with romance. He usually stays in the action genre, but switched it up for some reason."
    Violet "Well, I’m glad he did, because he’s a genius. The way he made the moon a symbol of a steady and persistent love was so good."
    Violet "It sounds lame when I say it, but I was so into it. I tear up every time I see the moon in real life now."
    Vincent "Dude, I think the moonshine shit was just an art flex. Light and shadows, you know?"

    Vincent "Either way, it was really cool. I liked the stuff he did when he went into the protagonists’ backstories for a few chapters."
